I am working my way into Web Development in Promineo Tech's Front End Bootcamp. I majored in English, minored in Graphic Design, and work with Linux and C++ @ github.com/CardioLeo/

Some of my most prized experiences include tutoring high school and college students, care-giving for the elderly and special needs communities, working and volunteering at Camp Barnabas (a summer camp for people with special needs), writing and rewriting a book of poems, working on (at the time) the only special-needs and wheel-chair accessible High Ropes Course in America, talking with close friends, reading philosophy, trying to make my wife laugh, reading with my kids, being silly with my kids, and puzzling over serious questions anytime, anywhere, with anyone who wants to.

I am passionate about learning new languages, understanding different cultures, finding beauty anywhere it presents itself, and seeing the history of words and ideas as they have made their way up to the present. I have taught myself lower-intermediate German and am working on other languages like Japanese, Spanish, Hebrew, Welsh and Mandarin Chinese.

I am also passionate about helping people I know come to peace with themselves and those around them as best as I can, as unobtrusively as I can. I spend a lot of time thinking about issues of conflict resolution, complex ethical and spiritual situations, how to help people understand each other, and, well, organic church planting.

I blog about technology, ethics, spirituality and language @ PerilousResonance.wordpress.com/
